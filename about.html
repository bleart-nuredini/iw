        <p>Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, 
        Tennessee, in 1999. The band is composed of brothers Caleb, Nathan and 
        Jared Followill with their cousin Matthew Followill.<br>
        The band's early music was a blend of Southern rock and blues influences, 
        but it has gradually evolved throughout the years to include a variety of 
        genres and a more alternative, arena rock sound. Kings of Leon achieved 
        initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards 
        in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaked in the top five 
        of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Because of the Times, also reached 
        the number one spot.<br>
        After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008, the band achieved 
        chart success in the United States. The singles "Sex on Fire", "Use Somebody", 
        and "Notion" all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The 
        album was their first Platinum-selling album in the United States, and was also 
        the best-selling album of 2008 in Australia, being certified platinum nine times.
        The band's fifth album, Come Around Sundown, was released on October 18, 2010. 
        Their sixth album, Mechanical Bull, was released on September 24, 2013. The 
        seventh studio album, Walls, was released on October 14, 2016. The group has 
        12 Grammy Award nominations, including 4 wins.</p>
