    <h1 id="about">About</h1>
    <p>Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, 
    Tennessee, in 1999.<br> The band is composed of brothers Caleb, Nathan and 
    Jared Followill with their cousin<br> Matthew Followill.
    The band's early music was a blend of Southern rock and blues<br> influences, 
    but it has gradually evolved throughout the years to include a variety of<br> 
    genres and a more alternative, arena rock sound. Kings of Leon achieved 
    initial success<br> in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards 
    in 2008, and all three of<br> the band's albums at the time peaked in the top five 
    of the UK Albums Chart.<br> Their third album, Because of the Times, also reached 
    the number one spot.<br>
    After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008, the band achieved 
    chart<br> success in the United States. The singles "Sex on Fire", "Use Somebody", 
    and "Notion"<br> all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The 
    album was their first Platinum-selling album in the United States, and was also 
    the best-selling album of 2008 in Australia, being certified platinum nine times.<br>
    The band's fifth album, Come Around Sundown, was released on October 18, 2010. <br>
    Their sixth album, Mechanical Bull, was released on September 24, 2013.<br> The 
    seventh studio album, Walls, was released on October 14, 2016. The group has <br>
    12 Grammy Award nominations, including 4 wins.</p>
